I am a graduate student at Washington University in St. Louis in the Data Analytics and Statistics Masters Program at the McKelvey School of Engineering. I am advised by Dr. Ben Wormleighton.

Research Interests
======
I am interested in applied mathematics for statistical questions about complex real-world systems such as climate and urban planning. A deep understanding of relevant data is at the heart of ensuring that those working directly on solving these problems are doing so in the most effective way. My research currently focuses on topological data analysis. In particular, I am interested in how persistence diagrams, one of many possible topological descriptors of data, can be used within common statistical procedures like hypothesis testing.
