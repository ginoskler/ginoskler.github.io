I am a master's student at Washington University in St. Louis in the Data Analytics and Statistics program at the McKelvey School of Engineering, advised by [Dr. Ben Wormleighton](https://sites.google.com/view/benw/). Recently, I have joined [NREL](nrel.gov) to support their work in concentrated solar power systems.

Research Interests
======
I am interested in applied geometry and topology across many computational and scientific fields. My research currently focuses on topological data analysis. In particular, I am interested in how persistence diagrams, one of many possible topological descriptors of data, can be used within common statistical procedures like hypothesis testing.

Recent Coursework
======
Spring 2025: Differential Topology, Differential Equations & Dynamical Systems

Fall 2024: Algebraic Topology

Spring 2024: Optimization, Modern Algebra, Bayesian Statistics

Fall 2023: Coding and Information Theory for Data Science, Introduction to Machine Learning, Mathematical Statistics

Spring 2023: Introduction to Differential Geometry, Analysis of Algorithms 

Personal
======
Away from the blackboard, I enjoy playing jazz piano, seeing live music, and practicing mixed martial arts.
