I am a graduate student at Washington University in St. Louis in the Data Analytics and Statistics Masters Program at the McKelvey School of Engineering.

Research Interests
======
I am interested in the intersection of mathematics with our world's major issues such as climate change and political instability. A deep understanding of relevant data is at the heart of ensuring that those working directly on solving these problems are doing so in the most effective way. I hope to contribute to the body of knowledge of newly emerging techniques such as topological data analysis and algebraic statistics.

Recent Coursework
======

Spring 2023: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Introduction to Differential Geometry, Analysis of Algorithms
