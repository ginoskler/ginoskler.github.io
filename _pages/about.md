I have recently graduated with my master's in statistics from Washington University in St. Louis, where my advisor was [Dr. Ben Wormleighton](https://sites.google.com/view/benw/home?authuser=0). I am currently a post-graduate intern at [NREL](https://nrel.gov) supporting their work in concentrated solar power systems.

Research Interests
======
I am interested in applied geometry and analysis across many computational and scientific fields. In past projects, I have worked on information geometry, topological data analysis, and Monte-Carlo simulations.

Recent Coursework
======
Spring 2025: Differential Topology, Differential Equations & Dynamical Systems

Fall 2024: Algebraic Topology

Spring 2024: Optimization, Modern Algebra, Bayesian Statistics

Fall 2023: Coding and Information Theory for Data Science, Introduction to Machine Learning, Mathematical Statistics

Spring 2023: Introduction to Differential Geometry, Analysis of Algorithms 

Personal
======
Away from the blackboard, I enjoy playing piano and bass guitar, seeing live music, and practicing mixed martial arts.
