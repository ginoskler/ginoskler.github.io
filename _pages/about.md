I am a master's student at Washington University in St. Louis in the Data Analytics and Statistics program at the McKelvey School of Engineering, advised by [Dr. Ben Wormleighton](https://sites.google.com/view/benw/).

Research Interests
======
I am interested in applied geometry and topology for statistics, dynamics, and optimization. My research currently focuses on topological data analysis. In particular, I am interested in how persistence diagrams, one of many possible topological descriptors of data, can be used within common statistical procedures like hypothesis testing.

Recent Coursework

Personal
======
Away from the blackboard, I enjoy playing jazz piano, seeing live music, and practicing mixed martial arts.
