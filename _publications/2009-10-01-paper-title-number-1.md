excerpt: 'We investigate the properties of a modification of a hypothesis testing algorithm for topological data analysis by replacing the Wasserstein distance function, used to compute the joint loss, with the Prokhorov distance. We conclude that the Prokhorov distance achieves comparable performance, with a notably decreased tendency to report extreme p-values.'
